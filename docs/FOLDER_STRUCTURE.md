# Pixxel Hardware Repository Structure — KiCAD Projects

This document defines the **standard folder layout** for Pixxel’s hardware design repositories using **KiCAD**.  
It ensures design consistency, reproducibility, and smooth collaboration across the various team at Pixxel.

## Folder Overview

## Root Directory Contents

| File/Folder | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|
| `USB-PD-Trigger-Board.kicad_pro` | Main KiCAD project file |
| `USB-PD-Trigger-Board.kicad_sch` | Root schematic |
| `USB-PD-Trigger-Board.kicad_pcb` | PCB layout |
| `Outputs.kicad_jobset` | Job definition for GitHub Actions |
| `README.md` | Overview and documentation hub |
| `.gitignore` | Version control exclusions |

> These are the only files that should appear in the root directory of this repo. Tweak your `.gitignore` file if your PC is generating any other caches, backups etc. Please close your KiCAD application before committing files for headache-avoidance and a sternly worded lecture :)

---

### `assets/`

Supporting visual and data files for documentation and simulation outputs.

**Use this for:**

- Renders, screenshots, and photos  
- Simulation plots and result files  
- Images embedded in other markdown documents  

---

### `docs/`

Markdown-based documentation that tracks the lifecycle of the board and provide inputs for teams working with these boards.

**Typical contents:**

- Interface Control Documents (ICDs)  
- Board Design Documents (DDs)
- Bring-up and test guides  

All critical docs should be linked from the main `README.md` for discoverability under the [Documentation Section](../README.md#documentation).

---

### `Subsheets/`

Contains **all child schematic pages** (`.kicad_sch`) except the root schematic.  
Keeps the top-level clean and allows KiCAD to resolve hierarchical paths properly.

---

### `packages3D/`

Houses STEP models generated by the **Archive 3D Models Plugin**.

- Files follow `${KIPRJMOD}/packages3D/` relative paths.  
- This folder should contain the **final 3D geometry** for all components used on the board.

---

### `simulation/`

A sandbox for all simulation-related work.

**Can include:**

- SPICE or ngspice setup files  
- Output data (plots, waveforms, CSV exports)

---

## Output Directories (Generated via GitHub Actions)

When `Outputs.kicad_jobset` is triggered in CI, it automatically creates two directories:  

---

### `Design-Outputs/`

Files generated for **quick reference, design reviews** and internal engineering use.

| File/Folder | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `USB-PD-Trigger-Board.pdf` | Full schematic PDF |
| `3DModel/` | PCB 3D model STEP file |
| `Layout/` | Single PDF with all layout layers |

---

### `Manufacturing-Outputs/`

Files for **fabrication, procurement, and assembly** teams.

| Folder/File | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `BOM/` | Manufacturing BoM |
| `Gerbers/` | Gerber + drill files and PDF maps |
| `XY-Data/` | Pick-and-Place data |

---

## Notes

- All outputs inside `Design-Outputs/` and `Manufacturing-Outputs/` should STRICTLY only be **CI-generated** using GitHub Actions Workflow.
- Always use **relative paths** for 3D models and subsheets.
